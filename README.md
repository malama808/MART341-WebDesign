Kaʻaumoana Ahina 
This is a completely new thing that Iʻm learning and I had to write notes for every term of the readings. I went over it a few times. I was able to get through the homework tonight. The challenging part for me is learning the sequence for doing the homework and follow all the different prompts. Also, I have to organize and manage the information in Moodle and GitHub and make sure that Iʻm checking all platforms. The successes is completing this assignment. I felt confused but Iʻll get it eventually. I plan to link up with classmates to help me understand better. I did catch on as I started to do the homework.
