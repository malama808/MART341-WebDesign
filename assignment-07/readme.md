Everything that Iʻm learning so far has been difficult. Now I recognized the different forms on other web browsers.
I definitely observed on the web the forms where youʻd click on "contact" then it drops down and you have to
fill out your information. I also noticed several submit buttons. I didnʻt realize it takes so much code input to create
any form.

Examples:

text: A good example for this would be when we sign on to our Moodle page and we have to  enter in our Netid# and password
selection: An example for selesction would be, radio buttons, select box/drop down selection, Checkbox element.
button input: Thereʻs a upload button, submit button, image button and button element. All of these buttons are used for
the purpose of submitting, whether it be your name, email and or many other things.
