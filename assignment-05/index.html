    <h1>Naupaka</h1>

    <h2>Gabrielle Ahuli ªi</h2>

    <hr/>

    <p>The story of Naupaka is a legend story of why a beautiful
      native shrub is both found in the mountain and at the
      shoreline beaches. Blooming from this shrub is only
      half a blossom. One half blooms at the beach shrub and
      the other half blooms is in the mountain. This love story
      speaks on, love, jealousy, and seperation.
      Hula practioners songwriters and storytellers are those
      inspired by this story.</p>
