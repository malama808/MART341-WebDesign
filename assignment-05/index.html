<h1>Naupaka</h1>

<h2>Gabrielle Ahuli ªi</h2>

<hr/>

<p>The story of Naupaka is a legend story of why a beautiful
  native shrub is both found in the mountain and at the
  shoreline beaches. Blooming from this shrub is only
  half a blossom. One half blooms at the beach shrub and
  the other half blooms is in the mountain. This love story
  speaks on, love, jealousy, and seperation.
  Hula practioners songwriters and storytellers are those
  inspired by this story.</p>
